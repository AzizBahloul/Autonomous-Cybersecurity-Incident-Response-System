# Autonomous Cybersecurity Incident Response System

## Overview
The Autonomous Cybersecurity Incident Response System is a fully autonomous AI-driven platform designed to detect, investigate, and mitigate cyber threats in real-time with zero human intervention. It comprises three core subsystems:

1. **Threat Detection & Forensics (Python/DL)**
   - Detects and analyzes potential threats using deep learning models.
   - Processes PCAP files and integrates with Kafka for real-time data ingestion.

2. **Network Monitoring & Orchestration (Go)**
   - Monitors network traffic and orchestrates data flow.
   - Produces Kafka messages for downstream processing.

3. **Automated Response & Hardening (Rust)**
   - Executes automated responses to detected threats.
   - Implements system hardening measures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running.
- **Kafka**: A Kafka broker must be running locally or accessible remotely.
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Go**: Version 1.20 or higher.
- **Rust**: Ensure Rust is installed via `rustup`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/autonomous-cybersecurity.git
   cd autonomous-cybersecurity
   ```

2. Set up the Kafka broker:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name kafka-broker -p 9092:9092 -e KAFKA_BROKER_ID=1 -e KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=localhost:2181 -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092 -e KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1 -e KAFKA_PROCESS_ROLES=broker confluentinc/cp-kafka:latest
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Build the Go and Rust components:
   ```bash
   cd autocidr/sensor/go-monitor
   go build

   cd ../../response/rust-actuator
   cargo build
   ```

## Usage

### Python Detector
1. Generate a sample PCAP file:
   ```bash
   python autocidr/detection/python-detector/src/generate_pcap.py
   ```

2. Run the Python detector:
   ```bash
   python autocidr/detection/python-detector/src/data_pipeline.py
   ```

### Go Monitor
1. Start the Go monitor:
   ```bash
   ./autocidr/sensor/go-monitor/go-monitor
   ```

### Rust Actuator
1. Run the Rust actuator:
   ```bash
   ./autocidr/response/rust-actuator/target/debug/rust-actuator
   ```
